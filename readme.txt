Steps to use the api numbers consumer

1)Extract the the ApiNumbersConsumer.zip in workspace folder of an IDE. (I Used the Eclipse IDE).	

2)Next,open your IDE and import a maven project existing, and go to where location of the aplication folder is, finally click on ok and then the application is able in your IDE.

3)Next run maven clean and maven install to import all plugins and dependecies of the spring project.

4)In addition you can go to the main class and run java application, now the application it'll be able to use, finally you can use a Postman app using the api adress to get the sort numbers or you can put the api adress in your browser and it's also will work.

Resume

The ApiNumbersConsumer application is running on localhost, so you need to import the application in your IDE to run the java application in the main class "ApiNumbersConsumerApplication.java" in com.apinumbersconsumer.br package, next the api application it'll be able on "localhost:8080/api/numbers", so in order that you can put this adress in you browser or you can test in our api run application such as POSTMAN.exe.

What's the goal of the Api Numbers Consumer?

The api will extract all numbers of pages in other api of Cross Store Commerce, and then will transform this numbers in a sort list numbers, finally the api load this sorted numbers and show to us in a json file.
